# Background Context
- (US Health Insurance Data set): This data set contains 1338 rows of insured data, where the Insurance charges are given against the following attributes of the insured:
  - Age: age of primary beneficiary
  - Sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
  - BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
  - Number of Children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
  - Smoker: Smoking
  - Region: the beneficiary’s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest
  - Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
 
### Objective: 
- Leverage statistical modeling techniques, specifically linear & polynomial regression, to analyze and predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance based on a variety of factors listed above. Through this analysis, the project aims to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships between these factors and insurance charges, thereby providing insights into how different attributes contribute to the determination of insurance premiums.
